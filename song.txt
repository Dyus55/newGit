Wake up, no pancakes, just syrup
Ten toes down, yeah, I stay on alert
I get it in like the first and the third
This shit I got on, it came out the dirt
All of this money, I feel like I'm cursed (yeah)
I lost my dawg, every day this shit hurt
(Yeah, I lost my dawg, every day this shit hurt)
His voice in my head keep on tellin' me, "Work"
Yeah, I work, work, work my ass off (yeah)
